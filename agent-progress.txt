Completed:
- Restructured dashboard layout with AI Coach at 30% width (3/10 columns)

- Styled TradeZella calendar with green/red backgrounds and weekly stats
- Reduced chart heights to 260px to fit calendar on screen
- Updated AI Coach prompts to be more critical and process-focused
- Increased maxOutputTokens from 1024 to 8192 for longer AI responses
- Fixed AI Coach section header colors (Tailwind purging issue)
  - Changed from dynamic template literals to static class names
  - Tailwind/Twind couldn't detect dynamically constructed classes at build time
  - All four sections now render with correct colors:
    - Strengths: emerald-400
    - Weaknesses & Patterns: amber-400
    - Key Insight: blue-400
    - Action Plan: purple-400

Technical Notes:
- Tailwind CSS purging removes unused classes at build time
- Dynamic class names like `${titleColor}` aren't detected by static analysis
- Solution: Use static class names directly in JSX return statements

Status: 15/15 tests passing - Dashboard polished and AI Coach colors fixed
