# PipPaper

### Elevating Trade Management and Journaling

Welcome to PipPaper, the platform that takes trade management and journaling to
a new level of professionalism and organization.

Designed with the serious trader in mind, PipPaper provides a comprehensive
solution for meticulously documenting and analyzing your trading activities.

PipPaper will be a standalone app free to use for every serious trader, just
import your trading csv en get insights into your trading behaviour

The rationale behind this project is that the current SAAS solutions are pretty
expensive, so I thought why not build a standalone version.

The stack will be quite simple
